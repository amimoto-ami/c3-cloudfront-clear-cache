In preview page, plugin add `post_date` query to avoid CloudFront cache.
And set `wordpress_loginuser_last_visit` cookie for avoid CloudFront cache too.

The `wordpress_loginuser_last_visit` cookie will be removed if user sign out.

= Invalidation(Clear Cache) Page URL =

3. Configure the plugin settings from wp-admin

== AWS IAM Policy Example ==

`
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "cloudfront:GetDistribution",
                "cloudfront:ListInvalidations",
                "cloudfront:GetStreamingDistribution",
                "cloudfront:GetDistributionConfig",
                "cloudfront:GetInvalidation",
                "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
`

**Note:** The `cloudfront:GetInvalidation` permission is required for viewing detailed invalidation information. If this permission is not granted, the detail view feature will be disabled gracefully without affecting other plugin functionality.

## Adding your configuration through env vars

The plugin can be configured by defining the following variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `C3_DISTRIBUTION_ID`

You can put these variables like the code into the wp-config.php

`php
define( 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', '' );
define( 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', '' );
define( 'C3_DISTRIBUTION_ID', '' );
`

== Cookie ==
